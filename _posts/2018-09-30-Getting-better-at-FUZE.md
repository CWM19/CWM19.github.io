    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>We asked ourselves how could we add more to this program to make it better.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We worked with each other so we didn't have to ask the teacher for help and we worked on getting better at coding.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We reflected on getting sorted faster than last week and to get started faster to efficiently use our time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We listened to what the teacher had to say and we all worked on something to do with our targets.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We could've remembered to bring all of our equipment needed; a USB stick so we can store the information we had and put it on another computer for next lesson, meaning we can start the next lesson faster.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will need to try to bring a USB stick to the lesson so I can save the file for the program and put it up on the other computer we will be using.</td>
