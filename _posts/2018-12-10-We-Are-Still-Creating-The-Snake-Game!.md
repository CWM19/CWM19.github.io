  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We began by getting the Fuze box, as usual, then we started off on the game and ran the game a few times to see what we have done so far.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>This lesson, is like last lesson, we were allowed to start straight a away and begin our projects to expand our knowledge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I believe we have as we got to do quite a lot during the lesson.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We did persevere as we thought we had done something wrong but it was nothing as we could solve it after examining the code for minor mistakes (typos).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>We were constantly asking ourselves What is wrong with the code and what can we do to fix it?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We were able to work with ourselves though we did ask for a reason why our code might have an error but during the lesson we only conferred with ourselves. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We were able to be very intrigued with the project therefore we were focused</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We were taking part in the project and focused solely on what to do. We were able to get very far as we were 'in the zone'.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning we could of stopped looking at our friends code or stop faffing about with said friends as they were further ahead of us. We could of been faster to identify the typos quicker or any other mistakes.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to stay focused solely on our work though allow us to chat but faff around. Maybe new time we could also try to identify what has gone wrong in the code.</td>
