  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We began as usual by getting out the Fuze box and setting it up for our task this lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to get further on the project and nearly complete it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I believe we have reached our target for the lesson as we completed nearly 2 pages as on average during the past lessons.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I think we have persevered as we had trouble getting the code right as I had typed up some typos nonetheless we were able to solve the problems and to continue on the task at hand.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>We were able to ask ourselves, 'What do we need to change to make sure that the code won't come up with another error message?â€™</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We were able to work on the Snake Game on our own as we were concentrated on completing it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think we were able to concentrate better this week by not getting distracted with our partners, we also were able to find and solve any typos or other mistakes in the code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We were able to get engaged with the lesson, we did this by concentrating on our code and to talk to one another and to solve any problems we might have.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Maybe I could have been quicker to type the code as I believe we could have finish the two pages and that I should of been able to use the mouse to point at the code to get it done quicker. Or I could of been able to say it with enough detail that my partner knew what I was saying.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I should write the code faster or hand it over to my partner as he can type faster than I. Also I could point out and say the code faster and clearer.</td>
