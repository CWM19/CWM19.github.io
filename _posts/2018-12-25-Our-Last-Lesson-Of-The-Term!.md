  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>As it was our last lesson of the Term we did things differently. We didn't get the Fuze Box out but we got to choose what we could do- Github, Thimble or Hour of Code. I chose to do Hour of Code and a bit of Thimble.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to work independently on any of the platforms of coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I believe I have reached my target as I was able to work on my own and complete most of the coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I think I have persevered during this lesson as I had struggled to find away to successfully get a picture up for my blog in the other blogs and have a link attached for my 2nd blog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had asked myself, 'How should I go about creating this code, should I use CSS or go into the HTML?'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>As my target was to independently work on my own I believe I have reached this target. No matter how hard I was struggling I was able to complete the task without any help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think I was very efficient during that lesson as I had gotten far with the coding and work given to us to complete.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>My engagement was good this lesson as I was able to work on my task with great efficiency and was intrigued with the task at hand.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Maybe I could of worked harder on choosing what to do quicker as I was in a pickle choosing what to do, eating up my time. In the end I was able to begin work on another blog site and to do some of the coding on the Hour of Code site. </td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I need to improve my reasoning and to do it quicker to choose a project to do. If we do this next time, I think I should choose the projects I want to do a bit quicker or to focus on just one project than splitting my mind on different projects. </td>
    <td></td>
