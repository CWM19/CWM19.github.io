Hi. This is a page about me. I am somwhere on Earth a place that should be called Water with it being made up of mostly water. One thing I can tell you is that I like to be up and about.

### More Information

Favourite superhero: DC Flash and MCU Spiderman. The Universe is big and constantly expanding but are we in the only universe or is there more, held together by space forcing us to stay in our own universe.
